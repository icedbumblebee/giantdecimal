# GiantDecimal

Originally written as a solution of [Decimal](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/decimal) exercise on [exercism.org](https://exercism.org).

Cargo-fuzz was used for improving the robustness of the library.

The library supports PartialEq, PartialOrd, Add, Sub and Mul trait implementations for the Decimal struct.
